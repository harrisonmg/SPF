# Stuck Pixel Fixer
This is a homebrew application for the Nintendo 3DS designed to fix stuck pixels on either screen.

A stuck pixel is a pixel stuck in a certain color, while a dead pixel is either black or white. Sometimes, stuck pixels can be fixed by rapidly flashing RGB colors on the screen, "shocking" them into working again. This method does not always work, however.

## Installation
Download `SPF.3dsx` into the `3ds` directory in the root of your SD card.

## Usage
Launch the app using the Homebrew Launcher.

Touch the screen to begin fixing pixels.

Hold the screen to display all black and find stuck pixels.

Press start at any time to return to the Homebrew Launcher menu.
